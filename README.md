# **Wireless to CAN converter**

Heracles is a qualified board for Automotive Applications.
The board was designed by KiCad.
It introduces the convertion between wireless connection (Bluetooth,BLE,WIFI) and CAN with the following features:

 - [ ] introduces a jtag debugging interface.
 
 - [ ] can be configured and managed by the integrated USB interface.
 
 - [ ] uses 3.8 to 38 V dc alimentation with very low drop down voltage
       values and very low power consumption .
 - [ ] ESP32­WROOM­32 running at 40Mhz to 160MHz.
 
 - [ ] A USB to UART converter.
 
 - [ ] USB type B port.
 
 - [ ] low-power co-processor that can be used instead of the CPU to
       save power while performing tasks that do not require much
       computing power, such as monitoring of peripherals.
       
 - [ ] Wireless connectivity: WI-FI (802.11 b/g/n ,802.11n up to 150
       Mbps), Bluetooth v4.2 and BLE.
